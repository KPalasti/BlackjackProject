# BlackjackProject
## Description
Emphasizing object orientated programming by simulating the construction of a poker table with suits, ranks, and cards which belong to a deck that can be utilized across multiple platforms for different games and patterns.
##Lessons Learned
Instantiating across files, more abstract methods and classes being utilized and thus deepening my familiarity with it substantially. I got lost in a huge loop of if, while, etc. in the future I think I need to stretch my initial planning diagram a bit better so I can account for this. I knew what I was intending to do but ultimately got lost in implementation and having a better guide could possibly prevent this.
##Technologies Used
Java, Atom, Github, Terminal, Zoom, Slack
